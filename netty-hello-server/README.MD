NIO
. Channels move blocks of data into and out of buffers to and from various I/O sources such as Socket, datagrams, File and so forth.
. Each SocketChannel is associated with a peer Socket
. SocketChannel.open() does not immediately connect. It creates an initially unconnectetd socket that must be connected later using the connect() method.

. The read() method of SocketChannel
If the channel is blocking, this method will read a least on byte or return -1 or throw an exception
If the channel is nonblocking, however, this method may reaturn 0.

. Just as with regular sockets, you should close a channel when you're done with it to free up the port and any other resource it may using

. ServerSocketChannel.open(). A factory method is rather than a constructor so that different virtual machines can provide different implementations of this class

Netty
. Given that inbound and outbound operations are distinct, you might wonder what happens when the two categories of handlers are mixed in the same ChannelPipeline.
Although inbound and outbound handlers are extend ChannelHandler. Netty distinguishes implementation of ChannelInboundHandler and ChannelOutboundHandler
and ensures that the data is passed only between handlers of the same directional type.

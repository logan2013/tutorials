    Keyhole was founded on the principle of delivering quality solutions through a talented technical team, and as such,
    knowledge transfer is important to us. We have a weekly <a href="https://keyholesoftware.com/blog">development
    blog</a>, as well as in-team Tech Nights to keep up on the latest in the industry. To our clients, we offer various
    techniques to provide the most value: one-on-one or group mentoring, lab/lecture educational <a
    href="https://keyholesoftware.com/services/education/">courses</a>, and access to our knowledge transfer engine <a
